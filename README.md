## Why Clau-Decode?

Your AI coding assistant writes a small mountain of JSONL session files into
`~/.claude/projects/` — useful, but unreadable and impossible to search by hand.
Clau-Decode reads those files locally, indexes them into SQLite, and serves a
fast browser UI with full-text search, conversation rendering, analytics, and a
recap engine.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install as an isolated tool — its own virtualenv, on your PATH, nothing
# touches your system Python. Use whichever you already have:
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Comradery64/Clau-Decode.git
# or:
pipx install git+https://github.com/Comradery64/Clau-Decode.git

clau-decode                 # opens http://localhost:4242
# update later:  uv tool upgrade clau-decode    (or: pipx upgrade clau-decode)
```

Requires Python 3.10+. The wheel ships the pre-built frontend, so **no Node.js is needed** — only for development. All data stays on your machine — no telemetry.

> Prefer not to install? Run it straight from a clone — see [Development](#development).
> Advanced: `pip install` works too, but only **inside an activated virtualenv** — never your system/Homebrew Python (PEP 668 will block it, and a global install can shadow other checkouts).

## Features

### Session browser
- Conversations grouped by project, with star and archive
- Sort by recent, oldest, or alphabetical
- Hover preview before opening a session

### Search
- `Cmd+K` global search across every session — content, tool use, file paths, thinking blocks
- Inline live-search bar on the home page for quick lookups
- Results show highlighted excerpts and jump directly to the matching message

### Conversation viewer
- Rendered markdown with code syntax highlighting
- Tool-use blocks showing files read, commands run, edits made
- Thinking blocks revealing the model's reasoning
- Sidechain branches for sub-agent conversations
- `Cmd+O` expand/collapse all tool + thinking blocks
- `Cmd+E` toggle full tool output without truncation

### Home dashboard
- One headline insight banner when something surprising happens (a big week, a major model shift, a heavily-used tool)
- 30-day activity heatmap and 7-day sparklines next to top-line counts
- Featured "Pick up where you left off" card, with an "awaiting you" marker on threads waiting for your reply
- Most-touched files (click to open in the file viewer)
- Clickable project strip filters the sidebar

### File viewer
- Slides in as a resizable split pane on the right; the sidebar collapses automatically and restores when you close it
- Drag the left edge to resize — the width persists across sessions
- Word-wrapped source — no horizontal scrolling for long lines
- Markdown files render formatted by default, with a one-click toggle to raw source
- In-place editing with `Cmd+S` to save, dirty-state indicator, and confirm-on-discard
- Sandboxed to session-related directories; refuses binary or oversized writes

### Analytics
- Daily, weekly, and per-session token + cost breakdowns
- Cost estimation with live pricing data
- Model usage breakdown and trends
- Tool usage statistics
- File touch analysis
- Optimization tips (repeated reads, oversized results, cache hit rates)

### Live updates
- File watcher tails session files in real time
- UI auto-refreshes when new messages arrive
- Notification bell for unread updates

### Sending messages
- Send messages to any session directly from the web UI
- Drives the local `claude` CLI in interactive TUI mode through a hidden PTY,
  so messages use subscription-backed interactive behavior
- Lazy spawn on chat-input focus; idle PTYs auto-kill after 5 minutes
- Login required on the host (the web UI doesn't surface OAuth)

### Export
- Export any conversation as JSON or Markdown — includes token counts and cost estimates

### Multi-profile support
- Switch between separate config directories (e.g. multiple Claude installations or sandboxes)
- Each profile has its own data paths and color
- Click the avatar in the bottom-left to switch

### Themes
- Light, dark, and system theme
- Dark mode is tuned for long sessions — neutral surfaces, accent reserved for primary actions and live signals

## Usage

### CLI

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--path PATH` | Add a scan path (repeatable) | auto-detected |
| `--port PORT` | Override the listening port | `4242` |
| `--host HOST` | Bind host | `127.0.0.1` |
| `--expose` | Bind to `0.0.0.0` (accessible on the local network) | off |
| `--no-open` | Don't open the browser on startup | opens browser |
| `--enable-edit` | Enable message editing + deletion (creates a backup before every write) | off |
| `--force-refresh` | Clear the cache and force a full rescan | off |
| `--since YYYYMMDD` | Only include sessions on or after this date | all |
| `--version` | Print version and exit | |

> `--expose` makes your chat history visible to anyone on the same network. Use it on trusted networks only.

**Subcommands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `clau-decode` | Launch the web UI (default) |
| `clau-decode scan` | Rescan and print summary |
| `clau-decode today` | Show today's token usage and cost |
| `clau-decode stats` | Print statistical metrics |
| `clau-decode tips` | Print optimization tips |

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+K` | Open global search |
| `Cmd+O` | Expand/collapse all tool + thinking blocks |
| `Cmd+E` | Toggle full tool results |
| `Cmd+S` | Save (in file editor) |
| `Cmd+I` | Toggle chat panel |
| `Cmd+B` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Shift+Cmd+,` | Open settings |
| `Esc` | Close dialog / search |

## Configuration

Settings are saved to `~/.config/clau-decode/config.json`. Edit them in the UI,
or directly:

```json
{
  "data_paths": ["~/.claude"],
  "theme": "system",
  "auto_open_browser": true,
  "port": 4242,
  "edit_enabled": false
}
```

The session index lives at `~/.cache/clau-decode/index.db`. Delete it to force a
full rescan, or run `clau-decode --force-refresh`.

## Architecture

Clau-Decode is a local-first FastAPI server that scans your AI coding
assistant's JSONL session files into a SQLite index, serves a React +
TypeScript SPA, and drives the Claude CLI through a hidden PTY for in-app
sessions.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for a system diagram and deeper notes.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Comradery64/Clau-Decode
cd Clau-Decode

# Install backend deps (into an isolated .venv) + build the frontend
make dev                      # = uv sync && build frontend

# Run the app from source — in the project venv, so it always runs THIS
# checkout (no global install, no shadowing):
uv run clau-decode --no-open
# equivalently, as a module from the checkout root:
uv run python -m clau_decode --no-open
# (make run wraps this)

# Run tests
make test

# Rebuild the frontend only
make frontend
```

Requires Python 3.10+, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Node.js 20+ for
frontend development.

GitHub Actions runs lint, type-check, and the Python + frontend test suites on
every PR — see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Acknowledgements

Clau-Decode is **inspired by, and built around the file format of, [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and Claude Code from [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)**.

> *A personal note from the author* — I didn't write the code in this repository or build any of the underlying tools. I sat at my computer, typed into it, and kept asking it for more. The actual line-by-line authoring was done by AI coding assistants — Anthropic's [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) (Sonnet and Opus) and [Z.ai](https://z.ai/)'s GLM-5.1, with the latter doing a substantial share of the heavy lifting alongside them.
