"""DriverManager — session-keyed owner of live ``ProviderDriver`` instances.

The driver-side analogue of ``PtyManager``: it owns one ``ProviderDriver`` per
driven session, fans the driver's output bytes onto the same SSE shapes the
Native transport already consumes (``pty_output_chunk`` / ``pty_native_state``),
and serves Native-view hydration snapshots — so the existing provider-agnostic
xterm.js renderer can drive a Codex session with no renderer changes.

What it deliberately does NOT have: an idle reaper. tmux sessions are meant to
**survive disconnect and idle** (that is the whole point of the tmux backend —
it fixes "the 5-minute reaper kills long tasks"). Sessions end only on an
explicit ``kill`` or clean ``shutdown``. Codex sessions never enter
``PtyManager``, so they are structurally excluded from its disconnect-kill.

Claude is intentionally never routed here; it keeps its tuned direct-PTY path.
