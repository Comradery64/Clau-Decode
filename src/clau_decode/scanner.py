"""File system scanner — discovers JSONL session files under configured root paths.

Contract (for Agent 2 to implement):
  scan_paths(root_paths: list[Path]) -> AsyncIterator[tuple[Project, Path]]
    - For each root path, walk projects/ subdirectory
    - Each immediate child of projects/ is a project directory (mangled path name)
    - Each *.jsonl file inside a project dir is a session
    - Yield (project, session_file_path) tuples
    - Also yield sessions from root_path/history.jsonl as a special "_history" project

  build_project_from_dir(dir_name: str, data_source: str) -> Project
    - Convert the mangled directory name into a Project object
    - Use _unmangle_project_id from parser to get a display name

  resolve_path(mangled: str) -> str | None
    - Try to resolve the mangled path back to a real filesystem path
    - Return None if the path doesn't exist

SOLID notes:
  - Single Responsibility: scanning only; no parsing, no DB writes
  - Callers (server.py) compose scanner + parser + db; this module doesn't know about them
