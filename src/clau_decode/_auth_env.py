"""Shared spawn-environment construction for claude-compatible binaries.

Centralises the "strip API-key vars or pass them through?" decision so all
PTY-backed spawn sites apply identical rules.

Decision matrix
---------------

``authMethod`` returned by ``<bin> auth status``:

- ``"claude.ai"`` — subscription auth. Strip ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` and
  ``ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`` from the spawn env, even if the user set them.
  This is the original billing safeguard: a stale env var would silently
  re-route traffic to an API account the user may not have intended to bill.
- ``"api_key"`` — pass everything through. The binary is self-aware that it
  uses API key auth; both the env key and any other config it cares about
  should reach the spawn.
- ``"none"`` / probe failure / unknown — pass everything through. The probe
  is unreliable for env-based wrappers (e.g. cc-mirror's ``zai``, which
  unsets the token before the probe runs, so the probe never sees it as
  ``api_key``). Stripping here would break the wrapper's only authentication
  path. The trade-off: a user with ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` exported and a
  binary that reports ``"none"`` will route to that key — but that requires
  the user to have explicitly exported the key, which is their signal.
