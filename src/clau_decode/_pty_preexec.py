"""PTY controlling-TTY attach wrapper.

uvloop's subprocess implementation does not run ``preexec_fn`` for safety
reasons (libuv constraint). The PTY runner needs ``setsid()`` +
``TIOCSCTTY`` on the slave fd before the spawned ``claude`` binary's main()
runs, or the TUI will fail to render.

Solution: invoke this wrapper as the entry point. It performs the
controlling-TTY claim in the *child* process (after Python's subprocess
infrastructure has dup2'd the slave fd into fd 0/1/2), then ``execvp`` into
the real target binary. From here on the child is fully detached and runs
under its own session with the slave as its controlling TTY.

Usage:
    python3 -m clau_decode._pty_preexec <bin_name> [args...]

The first argv after the module name is the target binary; remaining args
are forwarded.
