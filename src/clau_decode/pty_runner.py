"""PTY-attached runner — drives the CLI binary in interactive TUI mode.

One PTY + one ``claude`` subprocess per focused chat. ``PtyChannel`` owns
the low-level fd/termios plumbing (master/slave allocation, ``TIOCSCTTY``
controlling-terminal handoff, ``TIOCSWINSZ`` window sizing, non-blocking
master-fd drain via ``loop.add_reader``). ``PtyManager`` is the module
singleton attached to ``app.state.pty_manager`` — it orchestrates
lazy-spawn-on-focus, dead-PTY auto-respawn on submit, the 5-minute idle
timer with a 4-minute SSE warn, and clean shutdown.

There is no general per-session busy lock: ``submit()`` succeeds while a
normal turn is in flight so ``/btw`` can flow straight through to PTY stdin.
The one exception is an active ``/btw`` modal/capture; until that resolves,
new submits are rejected so foreground slash commands cannot be swallowed by
the modal. The hidden TUI interprets the bytes; clau-decode's existing JSONL
watcher → SQLite → SSE pipeline remains the canonical content channel for
non-ephemeral turns.

Phase 2 ships ``/btw`` ephemeral capture: both the user's input and
claude's PTY-rendered response are persisted to the ``ephemeral_messages``
table. See ``docs/pty-runner-plan.md`` Phase 2 and
``docs/pty-runner-phase2-spike.md`` for the full rationale and wire
protocol. HITL surfaces (auth modal, trust modal, stuck-session inline
notice) are deferred to later phases.
